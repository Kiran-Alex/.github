# Xade Finance 

> The super decentralised bank which provides all banking services on chain powered by our in-house DeFi protocols

Xade is the hybrid solution between DeFi and traditional banks which provides all banking services powered by our in-house DeFi protocols with the user experience of a digital bank in the most transparent, efficient and secure manner.

We provide a simple, easy to understand user experience which is indistinguishable from a digital banking experience through our premium and modern interface.

We are powered by our own in-house DeFi protocols which are designed to replicate real world banking services in the most efficient and sustainable manner possible.

We have created our product to be a direct competitor to traditional banks and aim to bring real world elements such as inflation in countries and tangible assets on chain.

We never take custody over your funds while being completely transparent and decentralized by keeping all our transactions,documents and codebase publicly accessible.
